My name is Mike and I'm currently a Master's student in Computer Science. I earned my Bachelor's degree from the [University of Texas at Arlington's College of Engineering](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering). I have a passion for learning, not just for the sake of memorization, but to deepen my understanding of how things are created and the thought processes behind a creator's mind. My interests in computing include:  
- Algorithms  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- System building  

I envision an ideal future where everything runs on-device and remains open-source.  

What defining my values
======
- Code that works > ~~ten-page polished report~~.
- Efficiency and results > ~~formality~~.
- Attention to small details is the foundation of everything.
- Layoffs are fair—everything operates under natural selection.
- A great engineer is defined by their integrity and pride in their work.
- Abstraction is a double-edged sword—understand how things work before relying on it.

My hobbies
